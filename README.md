# Credit-Card-Detection-REACH
The objective of this study was to determine the optimal machine learning algorithm for discriminating fraudulent and legitimate credit card transcations. The algorithms evaluated in this study were Decision Tree, Naive Bayes, K-Nearest Neighbor, XGBoost, Logistic Regression, and Support Vector Machine. 

The research and its results have been documented in a research paper (.pdf) and the code for the implementation is obtainable for download in Jupyter Notebook format (.ipynb).

Accuracy currently sits at 99%, but, future projects could shift towards creating an algorithm that can use a more diverse data set from around the world. 

# Credit-Card-Frauds

They are a type of:

 - A type of financial crime that involves the unauthorized use of someone's credit card or account information to make purchases or withdraw cash.
 - Committed using a variety of methods such as skimming, phishing, and identity theft.
 - Can result in financial loss for both the individual and the financial institution, as well as damage to the individual's credit score.

Credit card fraud is a major issue for financial institutions, costing them billions of dollars each year. Nearly 390,000 cases of credit card fraud were reported to the FTC in 2021, and another 118,191 in the first quarter of 2022. This highlights the importance of having robust systems in place for detecting and preventing credit card fraud. Using classifiers with a greater-than 99% chance of correctly identifying credit card frauds can greatly assist in mitigating the impact of such fraudulent activities (Maxwell, 2022).
